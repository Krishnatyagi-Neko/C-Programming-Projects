# C Programming Projects

A collection of projects I'm building while learning C programming.

## Projects

### 1. Number Guessing Game
A simple interactive game where the computer generates a random number (1-100) and provides hints until you guess correctly. Tracks the number of attempts taken.

**Concepts learned:**
- Random number generation with srand() and rand()
- Do-while loops for continuous user interaction
- Conditional logic for game feedback
- User input handling with scanf()
- Tracking game statistics
